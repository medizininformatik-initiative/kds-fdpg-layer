  *Hinweis für Implementierer:* 
  Der zu übermittelnde Bericht repräsentiert eine Zusammenfassung der strukturierten Daten aus dem Subsystem. Das Dokument KANN z.B. mittels KDL oder IHE-D-XDS-Typecodes klassifiziert werden.  
  Es KANN derzeit jedoch auch eine rein textuelle Beschreibung des Dokumenttyps angegeben werden.
  
  Während KDL-Codes eine feingranulare Dokumentenklassifikation für die gezielte Suche nach medizinischen und Administrativen Dokumenten ermöglichen,
  sind IHE-XDS-Type-Codes für den einrichtungsübergreifenden Dokumentenaustausch maßgeblich.
  Der XDS-Type-Code kann mit Hilfe der bereitgestellten [ConceptMaps](https://simplifier.net/kdl/~resources?category=ConceptMap)
  aus dem KDL-Code ermittelt werden.
  Weitere Typisierungen (z.B. nach SNOMED oder LOINC) sind uneingeschränkt erlaubt. [Konsens der Arbeitsgruppe vom 18.02.2022]. Im Falle, dass der Code 'UNK' entsprechend der ConceptMap verwendet werden soll, MUSS das System 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-NullFlavor' verwendet werden.","Key metadata element describing the composition, used in searching/filtering.","","","","","","","",,"preferred","Type of a composition.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/doc-typecodes","",,,,"Composition.type",1,1,"ele-1

There is no requirement that a Reference.identifier point to something that is actually exposed as a FHIR instance, but it SHALL point to a business concept that would be expected to be exposed as a FHIR instance, and that instance would need to be of a FHIR resource type allowed by the reference.","When an identifier is provided in place of a reference, any system processing the reference will only be able to resolve the identifier to a reference if it understands the business context in which the identifier is used. Sometimes this is global (e.g. a national identifier) but often it is not. For this reason, none of the useful mechanisms described for working with references (e.g. chaining, includes) are possible, nor should servers be expected to be able resolve the reference. Servers may accept an identifier based reference untouched, resolve it, and/or reject it - see CapabilityStatement.rest.resource.referencePolicy. 

When both an identifier and a literal reference are provided, the literal reference is preferred. Applications processing the resource are allowed - but not required - to check that the identifier matches the literal reference

Applications converting a logical reference to a literal reference may choose to leave the logical reference present, or remove it.

Reference is intended to point to a structure that can potentially be expressed as a FHIR resource, though there is no need for it to exist as an actual FHIR resource instance - except in as much as an application wishes to actual find the target of the reference. The content referred to be the identifier must meet the logical constraints implied by any limitations on what resource types are permitted for the reference.  For example, it would not be legitimate to send the identifier for a drug prescription if the type were Reference(Observation|DiagnosticReport).
